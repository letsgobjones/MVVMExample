# SwiftUI MVVM Product Catalog App ðŸ‘•

This project demonstrates a simple product catalog application built with SwiftUI, using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.

##  Features âœ¨

- **MVVM Architecture:**  Provides a clean separation of concerns for better code maintainability.
- **SwiftUI:** Leverages SwiftUI's declarative approach for building user interfaces.
- **Data Binding:** Updates the UI seamlessly when data changes using `@EnvironmentObject`.
- **Networking:**  Fetches product data asynchronously using `URLSession` and decodes JSON responses.
- **Error Handling:**  Includes error handling mechanisms to address potential network issues.
- **Navigation:** Enables users to navigate between the product list and detailed product views.

## Additional Techniques

- **Image Loading:** Uses `AsyncImage` for smooth image loading with placeholders.
- **Async/Await:** Employs the async/await pattern for more readable asynchronous code.
